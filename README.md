# OpenDC Frontend

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

The user-facing component of the OpenDC stack, allowing users to build and interact with their own (virtual) datacenters. Built in *React.js* and *Redux*, with the help of `create-react-app`.


## Architecture

The codebase follows a standard React.js structure, with static assets being contained in the `public` folder, while dynamic components and their styles are contained in `src`.
