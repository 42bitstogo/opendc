## 🐞 Want to report a bug or suggest a feature?

Encountered what you deem to be undesirable behavior? Have an idea for a feature that could be added? Please go to our [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/atlarge-research/opendc-frontend/issues) and have a look if there already is an issue addressing your concern. 

If there already is an issue, feel free to comment on the issue to show your support for it, or to add additional information that might be helpful. You can also just react with a thumbs-up 👍 to the issue or feature, to indicate that you'd be interested in its resolution. This can help us prioritize what we spend our development time on.

If you can't find an issue that fits your problem or feature request, [open a new one](https://github.com/atlarge-research/opendc-frontend/issues/new). Describe actual and expected behavior, and be as detailed as you can. We'll get back to you asap.


## 💻 Want to contribute code?

Great! [Fork this repo](https://github.com/atlarge-research/opendc-frontend/new/master) and submit a PR here when you're ready! Be sure to describe *what* you changed and *why* you changed it, to help us understand what your contribution is about.

* A couple of notes on the code itself:
  * Before you make changes to the codebase, have a look at the rest of the codebase (especially parts that are similar to what you want to achieve). Do you understand what they do? If not, feel free to [contact us](mailto:opendc@atlarge-research.com).
  * Try to write clean, concise, self-documenting code.
  * Don't worry too much about the formatting of your code: our `prettier` pre-commit hook takes care of formatting your code for you, automatically.
* A quick note on commit messages: Please follow common Git standards when writing commit messages, see [this post](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for details.
