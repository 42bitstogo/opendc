# Contributing to OpenDC

First of all, thanks for wanting to contribute! 🎉


## 💬 Have a question or general feedback relating to OpenDC?

Contact us at 📧[opendc@atlarge-research.com](mailto:opendc@atlarge-research.com)!


## 🐞 Want to report a bug or suggest a feature?

Please file an issue in one of our GitHub repos! OpenDC is a stack of a number of components, so here is a list of the different components with their respective domains. Please go to the one fits your bug or feature best:

* Docker or database setup? Go to [the main OpenDC repo](https://github.com/atlarge-research/opendc/issues).
* The web application? Go to [the frontend repo](https://github.com/atlarge-research/opendc-frontend/issues).
* The web server? Go to [the web server repo](https://github.com/atlarge-research/opendc-web-server/issues).
* The simulator? Go to [the simulator repo](https://github.com/atlarge-research/opendc-simulator/issues).

Once you are on the appropriate page for your issue report, have a look if someone has already filed an issue addressing your concern. 

If there already is such an issue, feel free to comment on the issue to show your support for it, or to add additional information that might be helpful. You can also just react with a thumbs-up 👍 to the issue, to indicate that you'd be interested in its resolution. This can help us prioritize what we spend our development time on.

If you can't find an issue that fits your problem or feature request, open a new one. Describe actual and expected behavior, and be as detailed as you can. We'll get back to you asap.


## 💻 Want to contribute code?

Great! If your contribution concerns overall stack setup (relating to Docker or the database), this repo is the right place to be! However, if you rather want to contribute to one of the components (the frontend, the web server, or the simulator), go to their respective repositories and look for documentation and guidelines for contribution there.

If you want to contribute to the main repository, [fork it](https://github.com/atlarge-research/opendc/new/master) and submit a PR here when you're ready! Be sure to describe *what* you changed and *why* you changed it, to help us understand what your contribution is about.

A quick note on commit messages: Please follow common Git standards when writing commit messages, see [this post](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for details.
