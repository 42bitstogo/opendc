# 2. Architecture Overview

**TODO: What are the main components (odcsim-core, odcsim-engine, opendc-core, opendc-format, opendc-testkit, opendc-workflows, I assume)? Short description of each in a bullet list (or even a schema drawing, if you have the time). Why this division?**

**TODO: One section per component, explaining what their responsibility is and what other modules they talk to. In what kind of scenarios do you as OpenDC developer need to touch/change them?**
