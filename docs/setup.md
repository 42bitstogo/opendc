# 1. Toolchain Setup

**TODO: Introduction: What basic libraries/language(s) do we use, with links to their respective sites. What tool do we recommend (IDEA probably). Explain that we will now give two alternative ways (IDEA and shell).**

## Installing Java

**TODO: Explain which version they need and where they can get it.**

## Setup With IntelliJ IDEA

**TODO: Take the user from not having IDEA to having the opendc-simulator codebase open in the environment. Finish with running a test to see if it works.**

## Setup With Shell

**TODO: Take the user from not having the codebase to having it and having all dependencies fetched with Gradle. This will likely need separate instructions for Windows and for Linux/MacOS. Advise maybe VS Code as editor to view things after installation. Finish with running a test to see if it works.**
