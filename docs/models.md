# 3. Pre-built Models

**TODO: Introduction: we have a library of pre-built models to make things easier for you, here we present them etc.**

**Per model in the architecture (corresponding with the architecture document), give the list of models we include out of the box. Explain what it does (and if applicable, what it doesn't do).**
